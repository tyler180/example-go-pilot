# Go + AWS Terraform setup

These additive callers use Terraform 1.15.0 in
`terraform` and shared workflow revision
`fc12894f6da97bb6bc4c9a8e407d31fadd51a401`. They do not create Terraform resources or replace
application CI, source code, CODEOWNERS, hooks, or existing Terraform.

Both callers are disabled until explicitly configured. Deployment is manual only.
There are no path filters: changes to Go source or Dockerfile can change Terraform
build inputs even when no `.tf` file changes. Fork PR plans are skipped.

## Configure before enabling

1. Add or retain your Terraform configuration, remote backend with locking, and
   committed `.terraform.lock.hcl`. Pin provider/module versions. Keep credentials
   and state out of Git. Do not use an empty scaffold as a deployment configuration.
2. Bootstrap GitHub OIDC and plan/apply roles separately. Match the actual repo PR,
   default-branch, and environment subjects. Give the plan role backend state-read
   and lock permissions; give apply state-write and scoped resource permissions.
3. Create the GitHub deployment environment with default-branch restrictions and
   required reviewers supported by your account. Merely naming an environment
   does not add approval protection.
4. Set repository Actions variables:

   | Variable | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `TERRAFORM_PLAN_ROLE_ARN` | Plan IAM role ARN |
   | `TERRAFORM_APPLY_ROLE_ARN` | Apply IAM role ARN |
   | `TERRAFORM_STATE_ID` | Unique state identifier within this repo |
   | `TERRAFORM_ENVIRONMENT` | Protected deployment environment name |
   | `TERRAFORM_AWS_REGION` | AWS region; defaults to `us-west-2` |
   | `TERRAFORM_ECR_REGISTRY` | Optional account ECR registry address for Docker builds |
   | `TERRAFORM_ENABLED` | `true` only after setup, to enable PR plans |
   | `TERRAFORM_DEPLOY_ENABLED` | `true` only when ready for manual deployment |

5. Run local fmt/validate, then review a real PR plan. Run the manual deployment
   from the default branch and review its fresh saved plan before environment
   approval. No apply is needed to test source rendering or YAML validation.

## Terraform-driven Docker builds

If Terraform builds/pushes an ECR image, set `TERRAFORM_ECR_REGISTRY` to its account
registry address. The shared workflows log Docker in using each job's AWS role.
Configure the Docker provider's `registry_auth` with `address` and
`config_file = pathexpand("~/.docker/config.json")`. Do not use a plan-time
`aws_ecr_authorization_token` password or config file contents in the provider:
a saved plan can otherwise replay the read-only plan role's token during apply.
The runtime Docker credential file stays outside the Terraform artifact bundle.

The plan may execute external build steps.
Check whether the modules require ECR writes during planning; a purely read-only
plan role may be insufficient. Shared deployment checks out the triggering commit
in both jobs, restoring the Terraform plan bundle for apply, so sibling Go files
and Dockerfile remain available. The runner must have a working Docker daemon and
the required target-platform build support. For local amd64 builds on the shared
Ubuntu runner, verify `docker info` and the actual module build during the first
reviewed plan. Do not add backend/provider secrets to workflow files.

## Existing repositories

Render with `--workflows-only` into a new staging directory, inspect these three
files, and add them through a PR. If either workflow filename or this guide already
exists, reconcile it manually instead of overwriting it. Keep existing Go CI and
Terraform intact. This installs source callers; importing repository settings into
`github-infra` is a separate adoption operation described in its adoption guide.

See the shared `github-workflows/TERRAFORM.md` for the complete caller contract.
